# Predictive Supply Chain Analytics using Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository applies advanced machine learning techniques to Supply Chain Management (SCM), focusing on demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and supplier risk analysis. It demonstrates the full data science workflow â€” from exploratory data analysis and preprocessing to model development, evaluation, and actionable business insights.  
The goal is to build data-driven solutions that enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and enable smarter decision-making in supply chain operations.

## Project Workflow
The project is structured into modular Jupyter notebooks that represent different stages of the pipeline:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding supply chain datasets, visualizing trends, and identifying inefficiencies.  
2. **Preprocessing:** Data cleaning, handling missing values, feature engineering, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.  
3. **Modeling:** Training baseline and advanced models for demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and risk prediction.  
4. **Evaluation:** Assessing models with appropriate metrics, confusion matrices, ROC curves, and error analysis.  
5. **Insights:** Extracting business-relevant findings to guide operational improvements and strategic decisions.
